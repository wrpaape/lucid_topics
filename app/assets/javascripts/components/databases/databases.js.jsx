          <p>
            If you've endured a PowerPoint presentation in a business setting in the 20 or 21st
            century chances are this guy popped up somewhere in the corner of the slide with the
            big messy flowchart. The universal symbol for database, the cylinder, has roots in
            technology that predates the database concept:
          </p>
          <Img src={ imgPath + 'drum.jpg' } />
          <p>
            Invented in the early 30's, drum memory was widely used as computer storage around
            the time early database models were being hashed out on the drawing board. You'd be
            blind not see the resemblance, however, a database as a system serves a
            purpose <strong>more thorough than a simple means of storage</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The general definition of a database is "a collection of information organized to provide
            efficient retrieval." Technically a floppy disk, an Excel spreadsheet, and even a rolodex qualifies
            as a database, but what developers most likely refer to when answering the question "What database
            does your product use?" is a <strong>database management system</strong>. or DBMS A DBMS
            is the interactive software layer through which programmers, their programs, and, indirectly,
            consumers find, change, and otherwise make use of the data stored in the actual database.

            Why Bother?
          </h3>
          <p>
            There's a reason why your exes' digits go into a little black book and Facebook incorporates
            the sophisticated DBMS "MySQL." In most cases pen and paper or 16GB of storage
            will suffice for managing personal phone numbers as this data is:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h4>
                Small
              </h4>
              <p>
                From A to Z the entirety of this set of data can be scanned with the human eye
                in a couple of page flips or some scrolling.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>
                Simple
              </h4>
              <p>
                A single association between a string of letters and the number(s) belonging
                to them is the only relationship of importance.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>
                Static
              </h4>
              <p>
                Contacts will need to be added, updated, or removed manageably infrequently.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Note the keyword "manageable." While there's probably a several-orders-of-magnitude
            shortage of manufactured notebooks outstanding required to house the Facebook database,
            even if it could be stored on paper maintaining the simple status updates of its userbase
            yet alone the dynamic rewiring of countless network relationships as friends are added
            and removed would dwarf the Great Wall or any other massive human endeavor in scale. The
            savvy assignment of a proper database-DBMS pair, however, <strong>makes it possible to
            harness such datasets of otherwise unmanageable size and complexity</strong>.

            How do they work?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Traditionally the means by which databases house their data can be modeled as <strong>a
            network of tables</strong>. Each table is identified by a name and consists of a series
            of rows and columns. Each row represents a single entry in the database, where an entry's
            attributes are set according to the values listed in each column or field.

            Take for example the archetypal "users" table above configured to keep track of
            data concerning, for instance, the userbase of a particular forum. Each "user" entry
            records the attributes listed in the table header:  our first user goes by the username
            of "jimchrist," has admin privileges, etc... This table configuration, or <strong>
            schema</strong>, so far looks like nothing your cookie-cutter spreadsheet software
            couldn't handle. So what if the owner of this website wanted to allow their users
            to make posts like a proper forum?  Not only that, but lets say they wanted to allow
            users to comment on posts and other comments as wellâ€“AND keep track of this interaction
            without having a nervous breakdown. This is where a proper DBMS excels over Excel.

            Note the fields having "id" or "type" in them.  These are called <strong>keys</strong> and
            make possible the robust efficiency and raw speed with which RDBMSs handle structured data.
            A key in most cases is unique and immutable and can be classified as either "primary" or "foreign."
            The convention is that field or column names indicating the primary key are labeled "id"
            and that foreign keys occupy the column (or columns in the case of polymorphic associations)
            labeled with the singular of the parent entry's table name followed by "id" and sometimes
            "type." Using this simple system of recording <strong>associations</strong> by <strong>
            inserting the parent entry's primary key into its child(ren) entry(ies) as a foreign key</strong>, a
            sophisticated network of otherwise independent tables of data can be established.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of our forum, the "one-to-many" association between a user and their posts can
            be handled without having to stuff the contents of every post belonging to each user in
            its corresponding entry in the "users" table. Rather a separate "posts" table is created
            where ownership of each post entry is expressed by the value of its foreign key "user_id."
            The case is similar with the "comments" table, however, since our forum allows for users
            to comment on posts AND other comments as well, ownership must be expressed through two
            foreign keys: "commentable_id" and "commentable_type" where commentable_type indicates
            which table (posts or comments) the RDBMS should look up for the parent having an id with
            the value of its commentable_id. Accordingly the polymorphic (meaning that this table can
            belong to two or more separate tables on a single association) association establishing one
            post-to-many comments AND one comment-to-many comments can be handled with ease.
          </p>
          <p>
            While our users-posts-comments database exhibits just two cases of the one-to-many association,
            a vast library of all types of "one-to-one," "one-to-many," and "many-to-many" associations
            are at your disposal with a standard RDBMS which can be tailored to your specific data-handling
            needs. In fact, whole careers are devoted to determining the "best" selection of RDBMS
            associations for configuring a client's database. That being said, a relational DBMS is
            not always the best match for certain sets of data. Particularly the handling of <strong>
            loosely structured</strong> or <strong>unstructured data</strong> is not their forte. For these

            The RDF Data Model
          </h3>
          <p>
            RDF or Resource Description Framework is a simple language for expressing data models,
            which refer to objects ("resources") and their associations or relationships. RDF Schema
            is a vocabulary for describing properties and classes of RDF-based resources, with semantics
            for generalized-hierarchies of such properies and classes. The RDF data model consists of
            resources, properties and values. Properties are the relationships that bind together
            resources and values.  A value, however, is either a resource or a primitive data type.
            The basic unit to represent information in RDF is the statement.

            Triplestore
          </h4>
          <p>
            The triplestore database, an RDF database that has become very popular across a wide range
            of applications as of late, has the ability to ingest diverse data, allowing flexibility to
            schema changes as data does not have to be reloaded. Particularly noteworthy is the triplestore's
            elegant handling of unstructured data, which is data that either:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              does not adhere to a predefined data model or schema, or, generally put,
            </li>
            <li>
              is not organized in some pre-defined manner.

            farms, fields, and clients) with its relationships <strong>established ahead of
            time</strong> by the allocation of keys. For example, if farmer "Garth" was contracted

            The key phrase "established ahead of time" means that a vanilla RDBMS's "knowledge"
            of the data it handles is limited to the exact specification of its entries' schema.
            Active Record + SQL knows that Garth sold strawberries because an entry on the
            "contracts" table points <strong>directly</strong> at Garth's and strawberries's

            What is a Neural Network?
          </h3>
          <p>
            (Artificial) Neural Networks are a family of statistical learning models
            inspired by the central nervouse system and are used to estimate or
            approximate functions that can depend on a large number of inputs and
            are generally unknown.

          <p>
            artificial neural networks are generally presented
            as systems of interconnected "neurons" which exchange messages between each
            other. The connections have numeric weights that can be tuned based on
            experience, making neural nets adaptive to inputs and capable of learning.

            Powerful Features of LISP
          </h3>
          <h4>
            Uniform Syntax
          </h4>
          <p>
            The syntax of Lisp programs is simple. This makes the language easy to learn,
            and very little time is wasted correcting typos. In addition, it is easy to
            write programs that <strong>manipulate other programs</strong> or <strong>
            define whole new languages</strong>.
          </p>
          <h4>
            The List
          </h4>
          <p>
            LISP programs are composed of a simple data structure:
            the list (hence <strong>LIS</strong>t <strong>P</strong>rocessing).
            A list is a nonatomic combination of objects enclosed by a set of
            parentheses (hence <strong>L</strong>ots of <strong>I</strong>rritating <strong>
            S</strong>tupid <strong>P</strong>arentheses).
            The list is a very versatile data structure, and while lists can be implemented in
            any language, Lisp makes it easy to use them. Many AI applications involve lists of
            constantly changing size, making fixed-length data structures like vectors harder to use.
          </p>
          <h4>
            The First-Class Function
          </h4>
          <p>
            Functions in LISP can not only be "called," or applied to arguments,
            they can also be manipulated just like any other kind of object.
            LISP was the first to implement this programming pattern of passing
            and returning of functions (called <strong>lambda expressions</strong>)
            within a program. Lambda expressions allow for the manipulation of and
            creation of new functions <strong>at run time</strong>. This powerful
            technique or <strong>closure</strong> is not possible in most
            traditional programming languages.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Interactive Environment
          </h4>
          <p>
            Traditionally, a programmer would write a complete program, compile it,
            correct any errors detected by the compiler, and then run and debug it.
            For long programs, waiting for the compiler occupied a large portion of
            the debugging time. In Lisp one normally writes a few small functions at
            a time, getting feedback from the Lisp system after evaluating each one.
            Accordingly, LISP has an <strong>interactive environment</strong> rather
            than a batch mode of interaction common among traditional languages
            and is condusive to prototyping and agile development.
